# Presentation

This presentation was given to the Zero Tolerance Gluten Free Homebrew Club in May, 2020. It is an informal presentation. We had lots of great discussion and I learned a lot from the experienced homebrewers. 

A recording of the virtual meeting [can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ika9fyR56MI&t=507s). The presentation begins at 7:57 into the video.
