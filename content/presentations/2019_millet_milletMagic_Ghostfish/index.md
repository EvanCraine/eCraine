# Presentation

This presentation was part of a series hosted by Ghostfish Brewing Company that focused on millet and the importance of millet malt for gluten free brewing. 

The presentations provided a brief overview of the Washington State University Sustainable Seed Systems Lab, information on millet production in WA and the pacific northwest, and an introduction to a Western SARE grant that would benefit alternative grains such as millet in brewing industry.

A PDF of the presentation slides are [available here](/presentations/2019_millet_milletMagic_Ghostfish/EBC_GhostfishMilletMagic_2.20.20.pdf).
