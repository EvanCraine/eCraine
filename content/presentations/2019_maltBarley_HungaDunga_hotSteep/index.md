# Tasting Presentation

This presentation was a collaboration with the University of Idaho Rural Roots program, as part of their monthly speaker series. Members of the community joined in a barley varietal tasting at Hunga Dunga Brewery, and had a chance to taste beers made with the barley malts they had just tasted as hot steeps. Our goal was to engage everyone with their senses, and explore the flavor contributions from distinct barley varieties. Members of the Sustainable Seed Systems lab also presented on their research projects focused on barley.
