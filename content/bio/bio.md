### Current position

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Legumes Breeding Program at The Land Institute. 

### Research focus

My position is focused on nutrition, food functionality, and food system integration for The Land Institute's perennial pulse crop candidate, Sainfoin. 

### Past positions and more about me
Originally recruited to work on heat tolerance in quinoa (*Chenopdium quinoa*) in Dr. Kevin Murphy’s Sustainable Seed Systems Lab at Washington State University, I was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship in April of 2017 to support my doctoral program. I had the challenge and unique opportunity to self-design and self-direct a research program at the nexus of plant breeding, sensory evaluation, crop science, and consumer engagement. My research efforts in breeding for end-use quality have focused on quinoa nutrition and malting barley quality and flavor. 

For the quinoa aspects of my program, I have stewarded international collaborations to understand how diverse global environments impact seed composition and seed morphology. I’ve supported this effort by developing an innovative, high throughput phenotyping system to evaluate end-use quality traits. Developing this system involved building relationships with collaborators who could provide technical support, purchasing equipment and pilot testing the system, hiring and training cohorts of undergraduate employees, implementing quality control methods, and curating and disseminating data and metadata to collaborators. I’ve successfully managed the analysis of over 6,000 samples thus far.  

I leveraged this experience and consulted with a quinoa seed company on ways to implement end-use quality phenotyping into their breeding program. Specifically, I outlined the necessary equipment and analyses for physicochemical characterization of germplasm, and ways to classify germplasm into end uses based on texture profiles and flour functionality. As a visiting scholar at The Land Institute, I applied my experiences in the context of novel perennial pulse and oil seed crops. Using knowledge of consumer food trends, I targeted evaluation of these crops for specific end-uses. I conducted a literature review, purchased equipment and wrote protocols for phenotyping and product formulation, and conducted sensory evaluations to determine consumer preferences.  

Working with malting barley, I’ve conducted several studies and outreach events to explore the influence of barley genotype on malt and beer quality and flavor. I led a consumer panel to investigate the relationships between hot steep malt, an emerging sensory method, and beer sensory, and identified how consumer demographics and consumption patterns influenced sensory evaluation. I conducted a sensory study at a Brewfest using locally grown, malted, and brewed barley, where we looked for differences between advanced barley breeding lines and a control using two different sensory methods. Using samples from the WSU and University of Idaho spring barley variety trails, I analyzed malt quality data to understand genotype-by-environment interactions, the complex relationships that contribute to the multidimensionality of the malt quality phenotype, and ultimately provide variety recommendations to producers based on stable trait expression across the environments. I endeavored to strengthen the regional grain economy through researcher-breeder-farmer-maltster-brewer-food science-consumer connections. 

Before starting my PhD at WSU, I lived and worked in Temple, TX for 8 months. In the spring of 2016, I joined the Juenger Lab at the University of Texas at Austin and worked as a technician on an extensive switchgrass (*Panicum virgatum*) ecology, physiology, and genomics projects while based at the Blackland Research and Extension Center under the supervision of Dr. Philip A. Faye. Dr. Faye provided support during a key transitional period in my career and helped to guide me towards graduate school, while providing opportunities to hone my skills. I assisted with establishment and maintenance of switchgrass plantings, collected and managed switchgrass data such as flowering phenology and panicle morphology, installed irrigation and soil respiration systems, and prepared root, rhizome, and tiller samples for carbon and nitrogen analysis. Working at one of eleven research sites for the project demanded keen attention to detail, effective communication and an ability to execute research protocols reliably without day-to-day supervision. The high level of project management and steadfast commitment to research integrity that I experienced during this time formed the foundation for my success at WSU. 

Before moving to Texas, I lived and worked in Venus, FL at Achbold Biological Station. In the fall of 2015, I joined the Plant Ecology Program as a research intern and was supervised by Dr. Eric Menges. I assisted with projects ranging from plant demography, to rare plant monitoring, community sampling, and restoration of disturbed areas and reintroduction of state and federally listed species. I enhanced my data entry and management skills. As an intern, I was also responsible for identifying and carrying out an independent research project. I focused on pollinator ecology and environmental stress physiology. For instance, I investigated the influence of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation on *Crotalaria spectabilis* water stress response. Using growth chambers and over 300 *C. spectabilis* seedlings, I measured leaf emergence, stem height growth rate, root to shoot ratio, leaf area, specific leaf area, and stomatal density. I analyzed data with SPSS and presented the results as a poster and seminar. This point in my life holds a special place in my heart. I came to have a deep appreciation for the Station’s work, the landscape that surrounded me, and for the community that I became a part of, with a backdrop of ecological principles, landscape conservation, and stewardship ethics in my mind.

Before moving to Florida, and following my undergraduate educations, I served as an AmeriCorps member in the Student Conservation Association on Vashon Island, WA, US during the summer of 2015. As a watershed restoration intern, I quickly learned how to apply varying land management strategies to mitigate risks to water quality and salmon spawning habitat. I developed a working knowledge of invasive and native plants and plant community composition in differing habitats, and learned how to design and construct various trail infrastructure pieces.  

In 2015, I earned a B.A. in Organismal Biology and Ecology and a minor in Biochemistry from Colorado College. Students at Colorado College take one class at a time, and 8 classes per year, as part of the "Block Plan". It is intensive and immersive experience. I learned how to learn, and to learn quickly, how to be flexible and adaptive, and how to work collaboratively within small, dynamic groups. Originally on a pre-med track, a sociology course on "Food, Community, and the Social Significance of Urban Agriculture" radically transformed my view on the role of "food" as medicine, as culture, and as activism. Ultimately, I shifted my program of study. My journey into plant science began with guidance from Dr. M. Shane Heschel and Dr. Sylvia "Tass" Kelso. I will be eternally grateful for their mentorship and support. Tass fostered a profound fascination with plant biology and botany. My advisor, Dr. M. Shane Heschel, provided me with fundamental training in study design and execution, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. I spent two summers as a plant physiology research assistant with Dr. Heschel and gained experience in field, greenhouse, and laboratory research methodologies. I wrote a thesis from this work, which was [published in 2016](https://doi.org/10.3398/064.076.0310). 

I was raised in rural eastern Pennsylvania, Madison, WI and northern ID and graduated from Middleton High School in Middleton, WI in 2011.
