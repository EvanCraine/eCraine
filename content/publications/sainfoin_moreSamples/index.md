abstract: *Onobrychis viciifolia* (hereafter sainfoin) is an autotetraploid (2n = 4x= 28), allogamous insect-pollinated perennial legume originating from the Caucasus that has historically been cultivated as a forage. As a perennial legume, sainfoin has the potential to improve the sustainability of agriculture and food systems in multiple ways. Sainfoin can provide continuous living cover and biological nitrogen fixation to enhance soil fertility and health. It can also provide ecosystem services as a resource for pollinators and wildlife in addition to nitrogen fixation. Building on this history of valuable uses, The Land Institute is developing sainfoin as a pulse crop for human use. With the goal of supporting human diets with a sustainable, perennial protein source and nutrient-dense crop, this innovation requires a thorough understanding of the chemical composition of sainfoin seeds to ensure safety and potential nutritional quality. Using seeds from commercial sainfoin varieties developed for forage production, grown by commercial sainfoin seed growers in the western United States, this study evaluates seed composition as part of an ongoing investigation into sainfoin's potential as a novel pulse. We found crude protein content (38.78%) comparable with soybean and lupine, fat content (6.96%) comparable with lupine and chickpea, and starch (7.1%) and dietary fiber content (48.96%) comparable with lupine. Phytic acid content was higher than pulses (1790.89 mg). Ash (3.81%), iron (64.14 ppm), and zinc contents (61.63 ppm) were in the higher end of the range for pulses. This study indicates that sainfoin could become a novel, nutrient-dense crop for human nutrition. Future studies are required to further characterize seed composition and safety and demonstrate how common legume processing techniques may influence nutritional quality.

summary:  This study evaluated the nutritional quality of sainfoin seeds, which were opportunistically sampled from commercial seed lots in Montana and Idaho, USA. This study demonstrates a unique seed composition for sainfoin, with possible benefits for human health and potential as a novel pulse crop. We found sainfoin crude protein content to be comparable with soybean and lupine and higher than other pulses. Fat content was comparable with chickpea and lupine. Ash content fell within the range for pulses, whereas zinc content was above the range for pulses. Phytic acid content was considerably higher than pulses, although common processing techniques may reduce phytic acid content to reasonable levels. Sainfoin had considerably higher dietary fiber content, which may indicate the potential for sainfoin to help pulse consumers meet or exceed dietary requirements to close the “fiber gap.” Future studies should corroborate these results, further characterize seed components, and evaluate seed samples from a wider genetic diversity, range of environments, and management practices. Additionally, common legume processing techniques, such as decortication, soaking, and cooking, may influence sainfoin nutritional quality and should be investigated. Ongoing and future research and breeding efforts will support the domestication and development of sainfoin as a potential novel perennial pulse crop, an effort being led by The Land Institute in collaboration with global partners.

As a perennial legume, sainfoin has the potential to improve the sustainability of agriculture and food systems in multiple ways. Sainfoin can provide continuous living cover and biological nitrogen fixation to enhance soil fertility and health. It can also provide ecosystem services as a resource for pollinators and wildlife in addition to nitrogen fixation. Building on this history of valuable uses, The Land Institute is developing sainfoin as a pulse crop for human use.

This study evaluated the nutritional quality of sainfoin seeds, which were opportunistically sampled from commercial seed lots in Montana and Idaho, USA. We found sainfoin to have a unique seed composition profile, with possible benefits for human health and potential as a novel pulse crop. 

Protein content was be comparable with soybean and lupine and higher than other pulses. Fat content was comparable with chickpea and lupine. Ash content fell within the range for pulses, whereas zinc content was above the range for pulses. Phytic acid content was considerably higher than pulses, although common processing techniques may reduce phytic acid content to reasonable levels. Sainfoin had considerably higher dietary fiber content, which may indicate the potential for sainfoin to help pulse consumers meet or exceed dietary requirements to close the “fiber gap.” 

Future studies should corroborate these results, further characterize seed components, and evaluate seed samples from a wider genetic diversity, range of environments, and management practices. Additionally, common legume processing techniques, such as decortication, soaking, and cooking, may influence sainfoin nutritional quality and should be investigated. Ongoing and future research and breeding efforts will support the domestication and development of sainfoin as a potential novel perennial pulse crop, an effort being led by The Land Institute in collaboration with global partners.
