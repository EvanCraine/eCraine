abstract: Quinoa (*Chenopodium quinoa* Willd.), a pseudocereal with high protein quality originating from the Andean region of South America, has broad genetic variation and adaptability to diverse agroecological conditions, contributing to the potential to serve as a global keystone protein crop in a changing climate. However, the germplasm resources currently available to facilitate quinoa expansion worldwide are restricted to a small portion of quinoa’s total genetic diversity, in part because of day-length sensitivity and issues related to seed sovereignty. This study aimed to characterize phenotypic relationships and variation within a quinoa world core collection. The 360 accessions were planted in a randomized complete block design with four replicates in each of two greenhouses in Pullman, WA during the summer of 2018. Phenological stages, plant height, and inflorescence characteristics were recorded. Seed yield, composition, thousand seed weight, nutritional composition, shape, size, and color were measured using a high-throughput phenotyping pipeline. Considerable variation existed among the germplasm. Crude protein content ranged from 11.24% to 17.81% (fixed at 14% moisture). We found that protein content was negatively correlated with yield and positively correlated with total amino acid content and days to harvest. Mean essential amino acids values met adult daily requirements but not leucine and lysine infant requirements. Yield was positively correlated with thousand seed weight and seed area, and negatively correlated with ash content and days to harvest. The accessions clustered into four groups, with one-group representing useful accessions for long-day breeding programs. The results of this study establish a practical resource for plant breeders to leverage as they strategically develop germplasm in support of the global expansion of quinoa.

summary:  We observed considerable variation existed among the quinoa accessions in the world core collection. Days to harvest, yield/plant, fruit set/ripening, days to anthesis, height at harvest, inflorescence area, TSW, inflorescence length, and total amino acid content contributed the most to the first principal component, which explained 39.8% of the total variation. The presence of day-length sensitivity accessions likely contributed to the extreme variation observed for days to harvest. These plants tended to have a phenotype characterized by greater height at harvest, larger panicle length, width and area, lower seed yield, and higher seed composition content. Principal component and cluster analysis illustrated how the germplasm could be separated according to the analyzed traits into four groups with unique variability. Group 1 represented accessions that may be the most relevant to long-day breeding programs, with accessions likely representing germplasm originating from higher latitudes in central and southern Chile (approximately 34-40°S). Group 1 was characterized by fewer days to harvest, lower height at harvest, and higher yield. However, this group did have lower protein and ash content than group 4, which likely represented accessions from the Highland germplasm pool originating from lower latitudes in Peru and Bolivia. We found that days to harvest had moderate negative correlations with yield, TSW and seed area, and moderate positive correlations with height at harvest, inflorescence area, crude protein and ash content. Yield had moderate positive correlations with seed size and TSW, and negative correlations with total amino acid, crude protein, and ash content. These results indicate that improvements to yield in quinoa must be made while simultaneously monitoring seed composition, to avoid selecting against nutritional quality in pursuit of higher yields. Using BLUEs, we provide insight into which accessions may have the most promising assembly of trait values. Overall, this study provides a much-needed phenotypic characterization of a diverse collection of accessible quinoa accessions, and provides insights into phenotypic relationships, which together will assist breeders in developing germplasm for novel production regions.

Quinoa has broad genetic variation and adaptability to diverse agroecological conditions, contributing to the potential to serve as a global keystone protein crop in a changing climate. This potential is motivating the development of quinoa varieties suitable for adoption in novel agroecological climates worldwide. 

To support this effort, this study aimed to i) characterize a quinoa world core collection for agronomic and end-use quality traits under long-day greenhouse conditions, ii) identify relationships between agronomic and end-use quality traits, and iii) calculate best linear unbiased estimators (BLUEs) and broad-sense heritability values to provide much needed information in support of quinoa research, development and production in non-traditional regions. Comparisons between advanced breeding lines and commercial varieties from the Washington State University (WSU) Sustainable Seed Systems Laboratory (SSSL) 2018 Quinoa Variety Trial (N = 26), and accessions from the World Core Collection (WCC) (N = 334), are given special attention and extrapolated to consider the potential benefits to long-day breeding programs. 

Overall, this study provides a much-needed phenotypic characterization of a diverse collection of accessible quinoa accessions, and provides insights into phenotypic relationships, which together will assist breeders in developing germplasm for novel production regions.
