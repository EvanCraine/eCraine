abstract: Differentiating agricultural products has been adopted as a strategy to improve farm profitability and thereby business sustainability. This study aimed to evaluate unique barley varieties for craft malting and brewing markets to enhance profitability for diversified grain growers in southwestern Washington. Advanced barley breeding lines from Washington State University (WSU) were compared to a control variety (CDC-Copeland) through field trials, experimental and commercial malting conditions, and consumer sensory evaluation. The beers differed only by the genotype-dependent malt. Malting conditions (experimental or commercial) and field replicate influenced five out of the eight malt quality traits measured, while genotype influenced seven out of eight of the traits. Consumers differentiated the beers through ranking, open description, and check all that apply during a central location test. Based on consumer liking, breeding lines 12WA_120.14 or 12WA_120.17 could replace CDC-Copeland in beers. A total of 83% of consumers responded that they would pay more for a beer if it would support local farmers. This value proposition represents an opportunity for consumer purchasing to support producers, who form the foundation of the craft malt and beer value chain and whose economic success will determine the sustainability of small farms in minor growing regions. We provide further evidence for the contributions of barley genotype to beer flavor, while tracing the impact of barley genotype from ground to glass.

Differentiating agricultural products has been adopted as a strategy to improve farm profitability and thereby business sustainability. 

This study aimed to evaluate unique barley varieties for craft malting and brewing markets to enhance profitability for diversified grain growers in southwestern Washington. Advanced barley breeding lines from Washington State University (WSU) were compared to a control variety (CDC-Copeland) through field trials, experimental and commercial malting conditions, and consumer sensory evaluation. The beers differed only by the genotype-dependent malt. 

Funding was provided through the Washington State University Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources (CSANR) Biologically Intensive Agriculture and Organic Farming (BIOAg) program (Project ID: 165). The Port of Olympia provided funding through their Economic Development Special Projects Program.
